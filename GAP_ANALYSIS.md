# Gap Analysis: Krayin Laravel CRM vs OnePageCRM

**Date:** 2026-03-04
**Purpose:** Identify feature gaps between Krayin Laravel CRM (open-source) and OnePageCRM (paid SaaS) to guide development priorities.

---

## Executive Summary

Krayin Laravel CRM is a capable open-source CRM built on Laravel + Vue.js with strong fundamentals in contact management, leads, pipelines, email, and automation. However, it lacks OnePageCRM's signature action-focused workflow, many polished UX features, mobile apps, and the breadth of third-party integrations. The biggest gaps are in the **Action Stream paradigm**, **mobile experience**, **email sophistication**, and **field sales tools**.

## Gap Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|

## 1. Core Philosophy: Action Stream & Next Actions

| OnePageCRM Feature | Krayin Status | Gap | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Action Stream (prioritized to-do list) | :red_circle: Missing | **CRITICAL** | Krayin has a dashboard but no action-stream paradigm. This is OnePageCRM's core differentiator. |
| Next Actions per contact | :red_circle: Missing | **CRITICAL** | Krayin has activities but no concept of a single "next action" tied to every contact. |
| Color-coded priority system | :red_circle: Missing | HIGH | No visual urgency indicators on follow-ups. |
| Team Stream | :red_circle: Missing | MEDIUM | No team-wide activity feed/stream view. |
| Distraction-free workspace | :yellow_circle: Partial | MEDIUM | Krayin's admin panel is functional but more complex/traditional than OnePageCRM's minimal design. |

**Recommendation:** The Action Stream is OnePageCRM's #1 differentiator. Building a "Next Action" system on top of Krayin's existing Activity module would be the single highest-impact feature to add.

Cross-platform mobile CRM app built with React Native (Expo) targeting iOS and Android. Connects to the Krayin CRM backend via the Public REST API.

## Core Screens

1. **Login / Auth** — Email + password, biometric unlock, session management
2. **Action Stream** — Prioritized list of next actions, swipe to complete/snooze
3. **Contacts** — Searchable contact list with quick-add, detail view
4. **Deals / Pipeline** — Kanban board (horizontal scroll), deal detail
5. **Activities** — Activity feed, create call/meeting/note
6. **Email** — Inbox, compose, reply (connected to synced email)
7. **Route Planner** — Map view of contacts, optimized route
8. **Business Card Scanner** — Camera capture, OCR, auto-create contact
9. **Notifications** — Push + in-app notification center
10. **Settings** — Account, sync preferences, branding display

## Technical Requirements

- **Minimum iOS:** 15.0
- **Minimum Android:** API 26 (Android 8.0)
